## Our Goal:

_"StaffBot"_ is a simple Node.js command-line application that takes user input and information about their software engineering team, then generates a HTML webpage including a summary for each person added to the team. Our goal is to provide a simple easy and intuitive experience for the user and create an appealing and personalized product using the information they have provided. When generating the HTML we want to create something easy to understand, simple to read, and accurate. _"StaffBot"_ can be used to easily log, record, and visualize your team all in one place with as much or little information as you desire making it simple to see your team and it's strengths or weaknesses.
